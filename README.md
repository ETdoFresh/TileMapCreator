# 2D Co-Creative Map Editor
A 2D Tile Map tool that uses AI collaborators to help human users create
a map they desire. This software is built with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) engine and will run directly in your browser.

## Map Creation Tool
This tool understands that every user has different needs. This map editor
is equipped with the following as a creative support tool for users.

- Tools (Paintbrush, Fill tool, Shape tools)
- Layering System
    - Using Tools
    - Random Noise Generation
    - Open Simplex Noise Generation
    - Voronoi/Worley Noise Generation
    - Wave Function Collapse (WFC)
    - Mask Layers

## How the AI Collaborators work
The map editor is also intended to be a co-creative piece of software.
The AI uses a combination of WFC and Genetic Algorithms to create interesting maps.
Each AI collaborator has a different personality which emphasize different
properties when gathering their rules to generate and accept output. The AI
properties can may also be configured for a more personalized collaborator.
